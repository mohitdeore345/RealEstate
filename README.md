Using the MERN stack, I created a real estate website that allows visitors to easily browse and select from
a variety of homes posted by landlords for rent or purchase. Implemented user-friendly interfaces and
functionalities to facilitate navigation and transactions.

Tools used: MongoDB, Expres.,React.js, Node.js, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Cloud Storage, Redux,
Tailwind CSS, Git, GitHub.
